# Ask Me Anything

A repository to ask [@womenintech](/../../) anything.


### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](/../../issues/new) on this
project.

We'll try to answer it as soon as we can get to it. Once its answered the
issue will be closed but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and we'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](/../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
filter on this repository to browse questions that have been answered in the past. Ideally let us try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping us on Twitter: 140 characters
makes everyone more efficient. We are [@womenintechme](https://twitter.com/womenintechme) on
Twitter.
